# Predicting-Plant-Growth-Stages-with-Environmental-and-Management-Data-Using-Power-BI
# 🌱 Predicting Plant Growth Stages Using Environmental and Management Data (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting plant growth stages using environmental and management-related data.  
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** is created to visualize how factors such as temperature, humidity, sunlight hours, soil type, and fertilizer type influence plant growth.

The dashboard is designed to provide **quick insights** using KPIs, slicers, and comparison charts, making it suitable for decision-making in agriculture and plant management scenarios.
